<h3 style="color:Red;">About Me</h3>
<p style="color:Green;">My name is LeAnn Mireles. I love to play basketball with my friends also going to the movies. 
I have two bunnies which their names are Robin and Precious also a dog name Jack.
I am a biology major, hoping to get a bachelors or a master's in forensics pathology.
I am a very competitive person and I do not let my guard down. 
Also I am a twin but we are fraternal; and people still forget what our names are.</p>
